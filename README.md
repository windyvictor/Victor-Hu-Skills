# Research & Academic Skills Collection

**English | [中文](./README.cn.md)**

> A set of AI Agent Skills built around three pillars: **the full research workflow**, **academic career development**, and **general-purpose thinking**.
> It covers a complete loop — **read papers → think through problems → do research → write papers → apply for funding → build a knowledge base** —
> plus official-document writing and a general thinking toolkit.

This repository contains **12 Skills**, primarily written in Chinese, following the common
`SKILL.md + references/` layout. In principle they work on any Agent platform that supports
this convention (WorkBuddy, Claude Code, Codex, and others).

Beyond the Skills, [`prompt-library/`](./prompt-library/paper-writing/README.md) holds a set of
ready-made paper-writing prompts (40 workflow schemes + 30 advanced English writing
instructions) kept verbatim, for copy-and-paste use. That folder carries no `SKILL.md`, so it
ships with the repository but is not registered as a Skill.

The root also carries a `SKILL.md`. It is a **collection router**: it holds no writing rules of
its own and exists only to send the agent to the right sub-Skill under `skills/`. You can use
the repository as one bundle, or take a single Skill out of it.

## What these Skills are

A Skill is essentially **a reusable professional workflow written for an AI**: it consists of a
`SKILL.md` (which declares *when to trigger* and *what process to follow*) and a number of
`references/` files (which hold the detailed knowledge, templates, and checklists). When you
raise a relevant request in conversation, the Agent automatically loads the matching Skill and
executes it according to an established method — turning "improvise on the spot" into
"follow an expert's process."

These Skills share three characteristics:

1. **Traceable provenance** — most domain knowledge is distilled from classic books, authoritative
   guides, or public papers, not invented on the fly.
2. **Actionable, not vague** — they provide decision criteria, checklists, writing formulas, and
   prompt templates rather than generic advice.
3. **Clear boundaries** — each states explicitly when to use it and *when not to*, avoiding
   over-triggering and misuse.

## Quick start

Every Skill is a self-contained directory — just copy it in.

**Option 1: Install the whole bundle (all 12 Skills at once)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cp -r <repo-name> ~/.workbuddy/skills/research-skillbox
```

The root `SKILL.md` is the collection router; `skills/` holds the 12 sub-Skills. The platform
loads the router first, then descends into `skills/` and registers all 12 sub-Skills.

**Option 2: Install a single Skill (global; available to all projects)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

# Copy the Skills you need into your user-level skills directory
cp -r <repo-name>/skills/research-paper-writing ~/.workbuddy/skills/
cp -r <repo-name>/skills/critical-paper-reading  ~/.workbuddy/skills/
# …copy as needed
```

**Option 3: Project-level install (active in one project only; easier to share with a team)**

```bash
mkdir -p <your-project>/.workbuddy/skills
cp -r <repo-name>/skills/research-paper-writing <your-project>/.workbuddy/skills/
```

After installing, restart the Agent or reload Skills. They will then trigger automatically in
conversation, or you can invoke them by name (e.g. "use research-paper-writing to help me draft
a literature review").

> Layout convention: `SKILL.md` is the entry point, `references/` holds knowledge fragments,
> `assets/` holds templates, and `scripts/` holds scripts. **When installing the bundle, the
> sub-Skills must sit under `skills/`**: most platforms descend only into that directory once a
> `SKILL.md` is present at the parent level, so sub-Skills placed anywhere else will not be
> registered automatically. If your platform requires specific frontmatter fields, add them per
> its documentation — the body needs no changes.

## Composing Skills

Each works well alone, but chaining them is far more powerful. A few typical chains:

- **From a pile of papers to a finished review**
  `critical-paper-reading` (read each paper, extract elements, raise critiques)
  → `zettelkasten-notes` (distill into literature cards and build links)
  → `research-paper-writing` (structure, write, and self-audit the review)

- **From an idea to a grant proposal**
  `research-copilot` (argue the scientific question and method feasibility)
  → `grant-proposal-ai` (write section by section, apply the prompt templates)
  → `academic-deai-writing` (strip boilerplate and AI traces)

- **From finishing a book to publishing an article**
  `socratic-reading` (four levels of reading, four core questions)
  → `zettelkasten-notes` (permanent notes)
  → `research-paper-writing` / `ai-gongwen-writing` (produce the final text)

## Sources and copyright notice

Some Skills in this repository **distill methodology and material from publicly published books,
courses, white papers, or public lectures** (e.g. paper-writing guides, literature-review
methodologies, mental-model courses, official-document writing handbooks). They were
**restructured, rewritten, and reorganized** by the author for personal learning and research
efficiency.

### Content falls into three categories — please treat them differently

| Category | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **① Distilled / rewritten** (the bulk) | Restatement and structural reorganization of key methods, not verbatim copying | The flows, rules, and checklists of each Skill; the functional distillation of ASD-STE100 controlled English in `output-escalation` / `research-copilot` |
| **② Verbatim quotations** (all sources cited) | Original sentences, prompt templates, or phrase banks kept for authenticity or functionality | The "金句 (Lecture N)" quotes in `modern-thinking-toolkit`; the verbatim prompt sets in `prompt-library/paper-writing/`; the academic phrase bank in `research-paper-writing` |
| **③ Third-party material under known copyright constraints** | Material whose owners explicitly restrict redistribution; such files carry prominent notices | *Academic Phrasebank* cited in `research-paper-writing` (University of Manchester — personal use only, electronic redistribution prohibited) |

### Citation conventions

- **Every verbatim quotation is set in quotation marks and attributed** (lecture number, chapter,
  author, or source file).
- **Wherever a method can be stated in our own words, we do so** — verbatim quotations are kept
  only where the original wording is irreplaceable or where functionality requires it (e.g. prompts
  meant to be copied and used as-is).
- **Every Skill directory's `README.md` includes a "References / Sources" list**, itemizing the
  source, author, origin, and what was borrowed — for traceability and credit.
- Third-party material under copyright constraints carries a prominent **usage and redistribution
  notice** in the relevant file.

### Rights and contact

- The MIT License of this repository **covers only the author's own contributions** and **does not
  alter** the ownership of any third-party material.
- If you hold rights to any original material and believe the content organized here infringes
  your rights, please contact us via an Issue and we will **remove or adjust the relevant content
  immediately**.

> Users are advised to follow their institution's academic integrity rules when citing output
> produced by these Skills. AI output must be human-verified; this repository assumes no academic
